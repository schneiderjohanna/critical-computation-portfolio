        This experimental camera detects and mirrors the current mood of its user. It can differentiate between three states of moods: happy, sad and sleepy - the states that I personally mostly find myself in currently. 
        It detects the states based on the movement and position of the user's mouth and eyes.

        In the beginning of my design process I came up with three ideas. My ideas included creating an underwater scenario, creating a kaleidoscope as well as creating an 'emotional mirror'. 
        For my Major Studio project, I am working with the expression of emotions via digital communication, which is why I decided to proceed with my latter idea. 
        In order to visualize the respective mood I created icons that I would associate with each of them - flowers for happiness, teardrops for sadness and Zzz icons. 
        Further, I was inspired for the visual design by a project by Petra Cortright, called 'VVEBCAM' (2007).

      <p>
        While creating this camera I realized how difficult it is for a program like this to detect very slight emotional cues in the face of the user. 
        Even though I tried my best to make it detect rather nuanced differences, the user has to show a very broad smile in order for the program to be able to detect happiness. 
        If I were to develop this project further, I would like to improve on this aspect. Ideally I would like to make the mirror being able to detect an emotion that the user themselves is not even fully consciously aware of.
