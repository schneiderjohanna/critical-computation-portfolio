        My intention with this game is to allow the user to get to know me better as a person by exploring and collecting words that strongly relate to my personal background, history and character. 
        In the first level, the user can learn about all the places I have lived to far, whereas the second level reveals how I would describe my own character and the third level is supposed to offer a glance into things I like and enjoy.

        For the design of this game I was very much inspired by a frame in Natalie Bookchin's 'The Intruder'. Since I have a very strong affinity to language and words in general, 
        I very much liked the idea to make use of these two elements in order to tell my story. The text scrolling in the background is one of my favorite short stories by Julio Cortazar, 'Bestiario'. The Vase functioning as a collector for the words is an heirloom of my grandmother and therefore of high sentimental value for me.

        Even though, this appeared to be way too much of a challenge in the beginning, I really enjoyed goinging through all the different stages of the process - from ideating to greyboxing to detailing and perfectionalizing the outcome. 
        I still believe that there are multiple possibilities for me to improve the design as well as the code of this game but I am also a little proud of what I have achieved so far. COming up with the right words was another challenge, that I didn't even think of in the beginning and definetely advanced my reflection on myself.
