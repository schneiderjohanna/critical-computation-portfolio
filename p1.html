        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        So I have chosen not so much an object, but a friend. 
        His name was Tiger and he was my cat growing up who passed away recently, morbid, I know. 
        But he had lived a very long and very good life and passed away from old age so don’t feel too bad. 
        He vanquished many mice and provided many many snuggles. 
        I tried to think of an object that I’ve lost that held any real sentiment to me but couldn’t, I’ve never put much stock in possessions like that. 
        Tiger was a very large tabby tom cat. He had short grey fur, with black tabby stripes. He had tan fur on his belly, feet and face, and an adorable white chin.
        His ears and nose were salmon pink and his eyes were a bright chartreuse. 
        We nicknamed him the mob boss, because he was an intimidating little guy who wasn’t afraid to use his claws to get his way.(Myles House)

        Design Process

      <p>
        I started with making a list of Tiger's key features, including the color of his fur, belly, feet, eyes, ears and nose. A
        s a next step, I made several hand sketches, trying to find a way to draw a cat only using 2D primitives. 
        Out of my options I chose the on eI liked most and transferred it to code, starting with the main body parts such as the body, head and tail. 
        As a next step, I added the smaller parts and color. Finally, I decided for a canvas background that would highlight Tiger's cute green eyes.

      <p>
        Myles described her cat Tiger in a very kind and emotional way. While reading, I could image how much he had meant to her and probably still does. 
        Of course, my image has a very high level of abstraction. Nevertheless, I believe that I was able to represent Tiger's key features. 
        The depiction of the image using code breaks up the subject (Tiger) into multiple smaller parts and assigns them with quite detailed attributes that can be easily overlooked by the viewer. 
        Along the design process, there were two major steps of interpretation required. 
        The first step included the shape, size and proportion, which needed much more thought and reflection due my limitation in possibilities.
        The second one the color and shade of the cat, which I found much easier to translate into a visual image.
