        "Exquisite corpse is a surrealist technique where players take turns to draw a portion of a figure while not being able to see what has already been drawn by other players. 
        The drawing gets revealed at the end, which tends to create surprising and unexpected forms and narratives."

        Hi, my name is Ralf. I might look a bit strange to you, but where I come from it's completely normal to consist of parts from different creatures. In my case, I was born with the soft and cold head of a snowman, 
        the hard and shiny body of a robot and the sleek and flexible fin of a shark. I love cold weather (warm summer days give me a terrible headache), taing a swim in the ocean and boxing. It's nice to meet you!

        Joey The Snowman - Johanna
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is Joey the snowman. He is feeling very hot and sweaty these days and is very much looking forward to the cooler season. 
        He lives in Central Park close to the ice rink and his favorite color is red because it suits his eyes so well. In his free time he enjoys watching people ice skating and kids throwing snowballs.

        Dave Bot The Robot - Nicky
      </h2>
      <p>
        Robot 3X93RL1 traveled the multiverse and decided to settle down on planet earth in 2020. He named himself Dave, a generic name. He wanted to blend in with the humans. 
        To look more human he decided to put on glasses and shoes, but forgot that his whole body is still exposed.
        His round belly is considered attractive in his universe, he was shocked that it’s considered unattractive here.
        Dave bot was found unresponsive after he tried the heart attack grill in Las Vegas - so he’s now an expensive corpse.

        Shark - Dry
      </h2>
      <p>
        I love the ocean. I always imagine that I could be changed into a  creature to live in the sea. There is an ancient legend, which is that the  song from the ocean can only be heard inside the ocean. People only  can hear the harsh sound on land. The character I create is a singing  shark. I want to create a marine organism that can sing the song when  it is standing on the ground.

        Throughout developing this project I gained the impression that I find it much easier to implement new concepts with all the knowlegde I gained throughout the last couple of weeks in the back of my mind. Also, this week's concept of user-defined functions was really helpful for the development of my code. Looking back on previous assignments, I could have saved a lot of time implementing this earlier. 
        Another thing that I am taking away from this assignment is that I really like working and exchanging ideas or drawings in groups. The outcome is always much more surprising than if every part of the project was developed by myself. This way, we also inform and influence each other's work as a group, which is especially helpful during this very early stage in learning.
