        Description

      <p>
        Press & Hold Mouse to see who I talked to last week!
  
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Over the last six days I collected the names of all the people I had a conversation with each day. The size of the speech bubble correlates to the number of people I have talked to that day. 
        The random movement of their Names should reflect the dynamic of the conversation as well as my fainted memory about the specific time, duration and content of these conversations. 
        Starting off with the blank speech bubbles and the color code on the bottom encourages to associate and assign days to each bubble, potentially offering a moment of surprise when the true relation is revealed.

        Data Collected:

        After deciding that I wanted to track the names of the people I talked with, I immmediately had the idea of respresenting this by using speech bubbles. 
        To include an interactive aspect, I introduced the random movement of the names which in my opinion also very well reflects how hard it is for me to recall most of these conversations, especially their time and content.
        Lastly, I found that the color code was a very simple and straightforward method to convey the day that these conversations took place.

      <p>
       Tracking this data was really interesting for me, since it really reflects the degree of social interaction that for me really depends on my schedule for each day. On friday for example I have a very interactive in-person class in the morning and I also went out for dinner and drinks with several friends, which makes that day the most 'busy' one in terms of interaction.
        On the other hand, I did not have class on Saturday and stayed home the entire day and therefore only interacted with my two roommates. All in all, I definetely gained a very good overview about my social interactions and how they correspond to my daily structure. SOmething that is not displayed in the representation i choose are definetely the aspects of the duration, content but especially also the value for me personally of each of the conversations.
        Looking back, I realise how hard it is to recall a conversation from several days ago despite knowing the name of the other person.
