      <p>
        Broccoli Clock

      </p>
      
      <p>
        Broccoli Clock visualizes the time until and after my favorite meal of the day - lunch - represented by my favorite food - broccoli. Instead of deviding a day into hours and minutes, Broccoli Clock measures time in 40 min time intervals - my ideal lenght of a meal. 
        While the broccoli on top represents lunch, the left bigger ellipse marks the time for breakfast, the right one the time for dinner. Broccoli Clock works similar to an hourglass and starts measuring time beginning with breakfast until completing the 24h day. 
        In order to make the functioning of the clock more visible, it is currently set to a faster speed (4 sec. represent 40 min.).

        Design Process

      <p>
        Starting off with my three sketches as ideas for the Experimental Clock, the Broccoli Clock was my favorite from the beginning, since it also appeared to be the most challenging to me. I did in fact face ultiple issues throughout the coding process and had to iterate the initial concept as well as the implementation several times. I am still not very happy with the result, since I ended up doing a lot of manual work (for the individual ellipses) that I would have liked to simplify through the use of variables or If Statements.

        Reflection
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        During this project I again realized how I find it much easier to explore and understand different concepts throughout the actual process of coding. For most of the parts I did not have a clear vision in mind but tackeled them with a very hands-on 'learning by doing' approach. I am starting to enjoy this process and am looking forward to all the (surprising) things that I will learn about and come across (by accident) in the near future!
