      <p>
        This Consentful Interface is meant to inform the user about the functioning of the experimental camera, which can be accessed by clicking a button. 
        The user can return to the main page at any moment by clicking the Return button.

      <p>
        I wanted to keep this interface as simle as possible while at the same time providing the user with as much information as needed. 
        In order to follow the F.R.I.E.S model, I incorporated a button that would allow the user to return and end the camera at any given moment.
        
      </p>

        Reflection
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        I believe that I was able to incorporate most aspects of the F.R.I.E.S model into my design. Nevertheless, I am not sure whether I was fully able to cover the aspects 'enthusiastic' and 'specific'. 
        I believe that in order to make this interface really specific, I myself would have to understand better, what exactly is happening when p5js is asking for permission to access the camera. 
        For further iteration, I could include a second page with more specific information about this, as I initially intended in my design sketches.
