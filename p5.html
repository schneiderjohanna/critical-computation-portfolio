        This pattern plays with the perception of grids and verticality. By slightly shifting horizontal lines and reducing their contrast towards the background, 
        the verticality of the pattern gets dissolved and reveals the grid of flowers that appeared much more linear and irregular before.

      <h2>
        Austrian Traditional Dress 'Dirndl' - Flower Pattern
      </h2>
      <p>
        The pattern I chose is very typical for the traditional austrian dresses called 'Dirndl' that developed as the clothing of Alpine peasants between the 16th and 18th century and are continued to be worn until today, 
        especially for festivities and special occasions. The colors and patterns vary from region to region, but the one I chose is designed after typical alpine flowers - the bright pink 'Alpenrose' ('alpine rose') as well as the deep purple 'Enzian' ('gentian'). 
        I am very fascinated by the delicateness and precision of the Dirndl patterns and wanted to reflect those aspect in my design. Furthermore, it is very typical for the dresses to combine two fabrics with different colors and prints as shown in the image - one of the patterns being 
        more rigid and regular with an emphasis on the vertical, while the other pattern is more loose and following a grid without emphasis of one particular direction. In my sketch, I therefore wanted to play with these two aspects of the verticality and the grid.

      <p>
        One important aspect that I felt like is being lost when transferring these patterns into a digital and animated version is the plasticity of the fabric itself. 
        I strongly believe that the patterns were developed with keeping the 'behavior' of the fabric, such as its movement and especially its pleats and wrinkles in mind, that very much underline the verticality of the pattern, whereas the flatnes of the screen takes away a lot of the liveliness and deliateness of the patterns.
        I do not believe that the animation recontextualizes the way the pattern was used very much though. In contrast, I feel like it gives the pattern some of its original liveliness and playfulness back.
