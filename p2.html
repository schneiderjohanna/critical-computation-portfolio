        This is a very simpe face generator using custom functions and variables to generate multiple variations of the same face.

        Design Process

      <p>
        I decided not to put too much effort into the graphial design for this assignment, since I really wanted to learn and understand the principles of functions, variables and random(). 
        Therefore, I started off with the simplest smiley face I could think of - an ellipse with two eyes and a mouth and slowly added more detail to the sketch. The idea of the two mouths turning was what I implemented as a last step.

        Reflection

      <p>
        I was a bit afraid that I would not be able to implement everything that we were asked for in this assignment but looking back, I am suprised how fast I was able to understand and implement the concepts. 
        This was also the first time that I was actually having fun coding, since the more I developed my sketch, the more ideas I had to improve it further!
